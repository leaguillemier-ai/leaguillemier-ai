# Hi, I'm Léa 👋

I'm a Creator Growth & Marketing Lead with 8+ years scaling creator ecosystems across startups, scale-ups, and global tech companies. 
I specialise in creator acquisition, activation, and education, and I’m deeply interested in how AI unlocks new forms of creativity and content production.

While I don’t use GitHub for engineering work, I actively follow open-source AI projects and experiment with AI tools in my day-to-day work.
